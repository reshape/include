Include other HTML files ("partials") into your HTML.

### Install

```sh
npm i reshape-include --save
```

### Usage

Given the following input files:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<p>Here's my partial:</p>
<include src='_partial.html'></include>
<p>after the partial</p>
```

```html
<!-- _partial.html -->
<strong>hello from the partial!</strong>
```

Process them with reshape:

```js
const {readFileSync} = require('fs')
const reshape = require('reshape')
const include = require('reshape-include')

const html = readFileSync('index.html')

reshape({ plugins: include() })
  .process(html)
  .then((result) => console.log(result.output()))
```

Output:

```html
<p>Here's my partial:</p>
<strong>hello from the partial!</strong>
<p>after the partial</p>
```

### Utilizing Different Parsers

Sometimes, you might want to import a `html` file into a `sgr` file. Or maybe a `svg`. In these cases and any other where you are seeking to mix two files that are processed by different parsers, you can utilize the  `parserRules` config value. Example shown below:

```js
const htmlParser = require('reshape-parser')
const sugarml = require('sugarml')

reshape({
  plugins: [
    include({
      parserRules: [
        { test: /\.sgr$/, parser: sugarml }
        { test: /\.html$/, parser: htmlParser }
      ]
    })
  ]
})
```

Note that anything not matched by a `parserRules` test will be parsed by whatever parser is being used by reshape from its primary config. So in the example above, the `html` test is unnecessary -- since reshape's default parser is `reshape-parser`, it will already use this for any file not matching `.sgr`.

Note that *any* parser can be used here in theory, but it must output a valid [Reshape AST](https://github.com/reshape/reshape#reshape-ast). Feel free to make use of the [reshape AST validator](https://github.com/reshape/plugin-util#validatetreetree) if you want in the process.

### Options

All options are optional, none are required.

| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **root** | Root path to resolve the include from | the file's path. |
| **alias**| Object with alias mappings, each key is your reference and the corresponding value is the relative path to your file. { button: './views/button.html } | |
| **parserRules**| Array of objects that can include the `test` (regex) and `parser` (fn) keys. See readme for further details | |

### Reporting Dependencies

This plugin will report its dependencies in the standard format as dictated by [reshape-loader](https://github.com/reshape/loader) if you pass `dependencies: []` as an option to reshape when it runs. Dependencies will be available on the output object under the `dependencies` key. For example:

```js
const reshape = require('reshape')
const include = require('reshape-include')

reshape({ plugins: [include()], dependencies: []})
  .process(someHtml)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res.dependencies)
    console.log(res.output())
  })
```

If you are using this with webpack, reshape-loader takes care of the dependency reporting and you don't have to do anything üòÅ
